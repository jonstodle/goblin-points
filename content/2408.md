# Intro
Velkommen! I'm Jon de Nor and this is Goblin Points.

This time I have the pleasure of having community member Ashley on the podcast. I was introduced to Ashley in a playtest we did together, and in the post-play chat I found her thoughts interesting. Today I get to share some of them with you!

Ashley and me actually ended up speaking for so long that I've had to split the interview into two parts. I like to keep the episodes under 30 minutes, and I'm not able to strictly keep that in this instance. There was just too much good stuff.

Before we jump in, I have to apologize for my microphone during the interview. It does a weird clipping thing and cuts off my words. I'll try to get that fixed for the next interview. Ashley sounds good though. Let's jump in!

# Interview
*Transcript imminent*

# Outro
And that's where we end it for now. I have a whole other episode of conversation for you in the next interview episode. So look out for that on the 20th of August.

A temporary thank you to Ashley for the conversation so far. Everything she mentioned is linked in the show notes and on [goblinpoints.com](https://goblinpoints.com/).

If you want to be on Goblin Points, do not hesitate to send me an e-mail on tips@goblinpoints.com.

Until next time. Snakkes.
